## Description

The Philosophers project at 42 explores the concepts of threading and process synchronization within the context of the famous Dining Philosophers Problem. The challenge involves simulating a scenario where philosophers sit around a table, alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping without running into deadlocks.

## Features

- Utilizes POSIX threads to simulate the actions of each philosopher.
- Implements mutexes for managing access to shared resources, such as forks.
- Avoids potential deadlocks and ensures no philosopher starves.

## Usage 

To clone the repository, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moop250/philosophers.git
```

Compilation & cleanup:

- `make` : Compiles the code.
- `make clean` : Would clean up object files (.o) if there were any.
- `make fclean` : Cleans up all files generated by the make command, including the executable.
- `make re` : Executes make fclean followed by make to recompile all the code.

Example usage:
```bash
./philosophers number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
